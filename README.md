# HOLC Redlining and Bird Diversity Observations in LA County

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to understand the impacts of racial segregation and how it can shape environmental data through the visualization of historical redlining overlaid with bird observation data. The redlining grades were created bu the 1930's Home Owners' Loan Corporation, and were discriminatory towards BIPOC. 

## Highlights

- Map creation
- Manipulating and visulizing raster data
- Professionalgeospatial workflow and output


## Repository Structure

The folder structure for this repository is a data folder, the `HOLC_Birds.qmd` quarto document, a README.md, and a .gitignore. The data folder is placed within the .gitignore, and contains folders for the ejscreen geospatial data, bird observation data, and the HOLC redlining data. The repository also contains the rendered files of the quarto doc.

## Data Access

The data used in this project was the EJScreen data, courtesy of the EPA. This allowed us to reference environmental justice data at the block group level. HOLC grade data was synthesized from the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Richmond, as part of the Mapping Inequality Project, Finally bird biodiversity observation data was taken from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.
